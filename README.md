# EduPredict: Student Performance Forecasting with Machine Learning

EduPredict is a machine learning-based web application designed to forecast student performance based on key factors such as study hours, attendance, and more. The system uses a regression model to predict a student's expected academic performance, enabling educators and institutions to gain insights into how various aspects impact students' success.

This project integrates a backend that processes data and model predictions, and a frontend developed with React.js, where users can input student details such as name, roll number, study hours, and attendance. The application processes these inputs to predict the student's performance, delivering actionable insights to teachers or academic staff.

**Features:**
1. Predict student performance using a machine learning regression model.
2. Simple and intuitive user interface for inputting student data.
3. Real-time prediction display based on input factors.
4. Backend API to serve the trained model.
5. Easy integration with various datasets to accommodate different academic environments.
